This README is for SSA plugin library (libopensmssa)
for OpenSM.

SSA plugin library functions as the core layer in
the SSA distribution tree. It can function as "pure"
core or as "combined" with access. Core layer
fans out SMDB to distribution nodes in the SSA tree.
OpenSM plugin is responsible for extracting the
SMDB.


Building
========
To make this directory, run:
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install

Typically the autogen and configure steps only need be done the first
time unless configure.ac or Makefile.am changes.
