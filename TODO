Issues, ToDo's thoughts etc
===========================

	1) Figure out what protocol (notifications, messages, etc) happens when
	nodes go away (both with AppDelete and without).

		Zookeeper, add messages to the control path notifying of these
		types of events.

	2) Figure out the locking/data xfer between OpenSM internals and the plugin.

		Do we use the internal data structures or make others?

	3) Use Zookeeper as the distributed DB?
