This README is for userspace SSA distribution.

The distribution layer is responsible for quickly and
efficiently exchanging data up and down the SSA
network of nodes.

Distribution node can be "pure" distribution or
"combined" which also supports access layer, or
access only. Distribution layer fans out SMDB
to access nodes. Access nodes support consumer
(ACM) nodes.


Building
========
To make this directory, run:
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install

Typically the autogen and configure steps only need be done the first
time unless configure.in or Makefile.am changes.

Libraries are installed by default at /usr/local/lib.
