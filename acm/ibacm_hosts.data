# InfiniBand Communication Management Assistant for clusters hosts file
#
# Entry format is:
# address IB GID [<QPN> [<flags>]]
#
# The address may be one of the following:
# host_name - ascii character string, up to 31 characters
# address - IPv4 or IPv6 formatted address
#
# There can be multiple entries for a single IB GID
#
# QPN    - remote QP number (optional)
#
# flags  - 8 bits that indicate the connected modes supported
#          by the remote interface:
#              bit 7 specifies "reliable connected" (RC) mode
#              bit 6 specifies "unreliable connected" (UC) mode
#              bits 5-0 are reserved and MUST be set to 0
#
#          * if no QPN was specified, flags should not be specified as well
#          * in case of only QPN specified, flags will get default 0x80 value
#
# All entries are divided into pkey sections. Before each section '[pkey=xxxx]'
# will specify the pkey value (should be in hex) for section entries.
# If empty '[]' appears then subsequent entries (till the next pkey section)
# will have the default pkey value: 0xffff. The same goes for entries without
# section specified (before any pkey section has started).
